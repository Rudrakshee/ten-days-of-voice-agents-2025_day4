# 🎙️ Murf AI Voice Agent – Day 4  
**Teach-the-Tutor: Active Recall Coach**

This repository contains my submission for **Day 4** of the Murf AI Voice Agents Challenge.  
For this task, I built a voice agent that helps users learn through **active recall**, using three interactive modes:

- **Learn** – explains concepts  
- **Quiz** – asks questions  
- **Teach Back** – user teaches the concept and receives feedback

## 📌 Current Status  
At the moment, **only the demo video has been uploaded** to this repository.

## 🔧 Coming Soon  
The following will be added shortly:

- Frontend implementation  
- Backend logic  
- JSON content file and agent flow setup

Stay tuned for updates! 🚀
